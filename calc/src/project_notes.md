I was able to get the check box to stay checked after closing and opening the modal again.
I was also able to add to and subtract form the state of that specific "class" of checks so that I can calculate the location total at the end.
Now I need to add the additional locations to the modal and configure calculations.

I was able to get the sonar pricing to show up in the "Monthly Total" on the info bar.
Next I have to zero out the cost when a check is deleted.
I also have to multiply the cost of each check against the number of checks defined.
